								<p>Hello! I'm Sneha Kumar, a recent graduate of Texas A&M University with a Bachelor's degree in International Studies and Spanish, and a minor in Business. While I find many concepts in International Relations intriguing, the importance of the 'globality' of business has stood out to me as a central aspect of our future. One of the fundamental driving forces in this field is data. The power of data lies in its ability to reveal trends and relationships that may not be immediately apparent to the human eye. To me, data tells a story. I envision each data point as a character in this story, where every input introduces a new element, leading to a change in the narrative.</p>
								<p>While I might have stretched this metaphor a bit, my passion for data analytics remains unwavering. I'm dedicated to pursuing a career in data analytics because I believe in its ability to empower us to make informed decisions and tackle complex problems. I am continuing my journey as a part-time student at Rice Univeristy in the Fall of 2024 to pursue a Master's degree in data science. This website serves as a portfolio showcasing some of the projects I've undertaken during my studies. Please feel free to explore my work, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or opportunities for collaboration.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Skills</h2>
								<h3>Programming Languages: </h3> <p>I have a strong proficiency in both SQL and Python. I've been working with Python since high school, so it's a language I'm very comfortable with. However, my journey with SQL is relatively new, and it's been fascinating to learn a language that's specifically optimized for working with structured data and primarily used for querying databases. SQL's syntax is quite distinct from Python, but I found it relatively easy to pick up.</p><p>Recently, I've taken the time to brush up on my Python skills and have delved into new techniques related to data manipulation and visualization. I've explored libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, NumPy, and Matplotlib, which have added significant capabilities to my data analysis and visualization toolkit.</p>
								<h3>Data Cleaning: </h3><p>In the early stages of my data analytics journey, I quickly grasped the significance of data preparation. It's akin to crafting a compelling story â€“ just as you wouldn't want underdeveloped characters or missing plotlines in your narrative, you also want your data to be reliable and complete. Achieving this often entails a crucial step known as data cleaning.</p><p>Throughout the data cleaning process, my focus is on ensuring the data's integrity. This involves several key steps, including the removal of duplicate entries, handling missing values, and reformatting the data for more effective analysis. By meticulously preprocessing the data in this manner, I can guarantee that no unreliable or erroneous data skews my results, ensuring the accuracy and trustworthiness of my analyses.</p>
								<h3>Data Visualization: </h3><p>In the realm of data analytics, the ability to translate complex data into easily understandable visuals is paramount. These visuals play a crucial role in ensuring that your findings resonate with the individuals responsible for making informed decisions. While Excel serves as a standard tool for creating basic visualizations, I've honed my expertise in using Tableau to craft compelling and insightful visuals from intricate datasets.</p><p>Tableau offers a myriad of advantages in this regard. It seamlessly connects to various data sources and harnesses the power of calculations to generate dynamic and informative visualizations. What truly sets Tableau apart is its diverse array of templates, enabling me to select the most suitable presentation style for showcasing the data's nuances. Moreover, Tableau's capability to merge individual sheets into cohesive dashboards allows me to present large volumes of data coherently and comprehensively.</p>
								<h3>Presentation and Documentation: </h3><p> Data and visualizations serve as the foundation for conveying a comprehensive narrative, but their impact remains unrealized without an effective storyteller. In my recent case study, I adopted a structured approach to presenting my findings. I created presentation slides that started with an executive summary, providing a concise overview. Following this introduction, I seamlessly integrated the data and visualizations, which illustrated the key insights that ultimately underpinned my conclusions.</p><p>Additionally, I leveraged Github Pages and Jupyter notebooks to create in-depth documentation that elucidates the entire analysis process. Within these resources, I consistently adhere to the six fundamental data analysis steps: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act. This structured framework ensures that not only the results but also the journey taken during the analysis are comprehensively outlined, facilitating a holistic understanding of the data-driven decision-making process.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Journey</h2>
								<h3>From International Studies to Data Analytics: </h3> <p>As an International Studies major at Texas A&M University, the scope of my academic material revolved around understanding globalization. Globalization refers to the interconnectedness of our modern world system. This interdependence stems from a data-driven society, where data is harnessed in decision-making across various industries. Its global prominence sparked my curiosity in the field of Data Analytics. </p>
								<h3>Leveraging Transferable Skills: </h3>
									<h4> 1. Analytical Thinking</h4>
										<p>International studies comprise many multifaceted global issues, such as ethnic conflicts, economic disparities, and environmental challenges. Breaking down these complex issues into smaller, more manageable components is necessary to comprehend them. The ability to dissect complex issues can be applied to working with confusing datasets and deriving actionable insights.</p>
									<h4> 2. Critical Evaluation of Information:</h4>
										<p>Research is a fundamental aspect of International Studies. While working on my 40-page research paper, I was overwhelmed with the various sources of information needed to analyze, including news reports, academic papers, and policy documents. In an era of information overload, both International Studies and Data Analytics require the ability to gather, clean, and analyze data effectively.</p>
									<h4> 3. Global Perspectives: </h4>
										<p>International Studies majors study different cultures and worldviews. It is important that we compare these perspectives critically, fostering a deeper appreciation for cultural diversity and a nuanced understanding of global issues. This can prove useful when interpreting and drawing meaningful conclusions from data, as it is important to look at the problem from different points of view.</p>
								<h3>Overcoming Challenges: </h3>
									<p>The most significant hurdle was the apparent mismatch in skillsets. My International Studies background honed my critical thinking and research skills, but it lacked the technical expertise demanded by the field of Data Analytics. It was clear that I needed to bridge this gap. Fortunately, my Business Minor included an Information Systems and Technology Management class, which gave me proficiency in Microsoft Excel.</p>
									<p>However, as I delved deeper into the field of Data Analytics, I discovered the importance of new programming languages, such as SQL, Python, and R. Python was somewhat familiar to me from my high school computer science experience, but I hadn't used it for data analysis. Additionally, I learned about data visualization platforms like Tableau and Power BI.</p>
									<p>To kickstart my learning journey, I enrolled in a 24-week course with Google's Data Analytics program. It served as an excellent introduction to the field, but I knew that true proficiency required more practice. I started by completing an online capstone project provided by Google. This involved defining a business task, cleaning and processing 12 datasets with over 300,000 rows, and investigating the relationships between various data points. You can find this capstone project in my Projects tab. I chose to approach the case study using SQL, and in the process, I gained expertise in querying. I also decided to create data visualizations in Tableau, which I found incredibly effective for representing my findings. Additionally, I honed my SQL skills by practicing on LeetCode.</p>
									<p>Furthermore, I decided to pursue a refresher course in Python. FreeCodeCamp offered a Data Analysis with Python course that introduced me to essential functions such as Pandas and Seaborn, which I consider critical for effective data cleaning and manipulation. To apply what I learned, I embarked on an exploratory data analysis project using a dataset I found on Kaggle, which is also linked in my Projects tab.</p>
									<p>I remain committed to developing my technical skills to become a highly qualified data analyst. While I'm still relatively new to the field, my passion and curiosity continue to drive me to learn more and enhance my skills.</p>
